# 3D-Prog-Platypous-Controller
- Creator: Sipos Levente
- Teammate: Albert DÃ¡vid

<br />

# Short description
*Our project goal was to control the movement of the robot using the accelerometer built into the phone.*
<br /> We used the [PlatypOUs-Mobile-Robot-Platform](https://github.com/ABC-iRobotics/PlatypOUs-Mobile-Robot-Platform) fore the implementation.
<br />

## The task required:

- [x] [Make a mobil application](https://github.com/SiposLevente/3D-Prog-Platypous-Controller/tree/main/android_app) or [Webpage](https://github.com/SiposLevente/3D-Prog-Platypous-Controller/tree/main/webpage)
- [x] Make (own) MQTT server
- [x] Write [some code](https://github.com/SiposLevente/3D-Prog-Platypous-Controller/tree/main/ros) for the robot movement

<br />

*For our other project in MaxWhere the goal was to get the exact location from the robot in real time and display it in the virtual world.*
- [x]  Odometry datas from Platypous
- [X]  Make (own) MQTT server
- [x] Write [some code](https://github.com/SiposLevente/3D-Prog-Platypous-Controller/tree/main/ros) to get the datas
- [ ]  Plarypous 3D modell
- [ ]  Node-RED
