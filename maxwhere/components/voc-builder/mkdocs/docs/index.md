# MaxWhere - VOC builder

A MaxWhere component that enables visual programming of a MaxWhere space.

The VOC-Builder is integrating Node-RED to MaxWhere that can enable the use of the so called flow based visual programming.

This project aims to implement the functionalities of the MaxWhere WOM API in the form of Node-RED nodes, which makes possible to build Where-s without any coding.

## Node-RED

Node-RED is a flow-based programming tool, originally developed by IBMâ€™s Emerging Technology Services team and now a part of the JS Foundation.

### Runtime/Editor

Node-RED consists of a Node.js based runtime that you point a web browser at to access the flow editor. Within the browser you create your application by dragging nodes from your palette into a workspace and start to wire them together. With a single click, the application is deployed back to the runtime where it is run.

The palette of nodes can be easily extended by installing new nodes created by the community and the flows you create can be easily shared as JSON files.

For more information about Node-RED please visit the official [Node-RED docs](https://nodered.org/docs/).
